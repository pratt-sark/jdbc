#JDBC 

Brief: Demonstration of a connection to a remote database using JDBC. 

Just for info: The database contains some of the members of the current Manchester United squad.

___WHICH FILES TO OPEN AND/OR DOWNLOAD___

File to be downloaded and executed for testing: *runThis.exe*

File having the main java application code: *conn_JDBC_remote.java*

File having the SQL Script I executed in the remote database: *remote_man.sql*

Remote database server is provided by: https://www.freemysqlhosting.net

This is a free and simple solution to host a database online (not sponsored, I swear)

If you've skipped the above stuff....

RUN THE runThis.exe FILE TO TEST THE APPLICATION.

CHECK THE conn_JDBC_remote.java FOR THE APPLICATION CODE.

CHECK THE remote_man.sql FOR THE SQL QUERY SCRIPT.
