# JDBC

### Demonstration of working with a remote database using JDBC. 

Just for info: The database contains some of the members of the current Manchester United squad.

#### ___WHICH FILES TO OPEN AND/OR DOWNLOAD___

#### VISIT "Assignment2" FOLDER
##### Ignore stuff in the root folder for now, focus on "Assignment2"

File to be downloaded and executed for testing:      **.exe files**     
File having the main java application code:          **.java files**     
SQL Script I executed in the remote database:        **remote_man.sql**   

Remote database server is provided by: https://www.freemysqlhosting.net

This is a free and simple solution to host a database online (not sponsored, I swear)

#### Remember....

DOWNLOAD THE **.JPG** AND **.TXT** FILES BEFORE TESTING THE APPLICATIONS. 
ALSO, KEEP THEM IN SAME FOLDER.
CHECK THE **remote_man.sql** FOR THE SQL QUERY SCRIPT.
